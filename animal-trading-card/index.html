      <p>The coat is often a cream color and fluffy, which deflects heat during the day and keeps the fox warm at night. The fennec's characteristic ears are the largest among all foxes relative to body size. They serve to dissipate heat, and are sensitive enough to hear prey that may be underground. The soles of its feet are protected from the hot desert sand by thick fur.</p>
