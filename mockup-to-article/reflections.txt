You've learned a lot about web development so far. 
I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. 
Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?
  
* What has been easy?
  
* What has been difficult?
  
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* In this project while I feel I did not learn a new skill, I did have fun and come away with some new techniques of doing things.
For example: I was able to incorperate some HTML 5 tags that I had not previoucly been familiar with such as <time> or <article> There was alot of varations in the formating and was nice to try without the use of CSS.

*the main layout and formating was simple.

* some of the details like the footnote, they weren't difficult but not straight forward either

* Since this was the first project and I recently completed it I can't say I have used these skills yet. looking forward to utilizing them in the future.
